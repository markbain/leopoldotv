title: 'If I Never Met You'

Eventually, like the Voice Of God, Mick interrupted in the intercom and said: ‘We’re getting you moving! Only a couple of minutes,’ and both of them whooped their relief.

The lift jolted into life and Laurie would 

1. never take its movement for granted again and 
2. be getting the stairs from now on anyway.

Mick was waiting for them on the ground floor, looking delighted.

‘Were you about to start drinking your urine?’

‘I’m certainly going to drink some imported Czech urine now,’ Jamie said.

‘Hell yes,’ Laurie said, and wondered if she and Jamie Carter would ever speak again, outside shop talk. Sharing this ordeal was worth a ‘hi’ in the corridor, and a head nod if their eyes met in departmental meetings. Maybe not much more.

They said their hearty goodnights to Mick, and thanked their saviour, the man in the boiler suit with the monkey wrench.

As Jamie held the front door for Laurie, he said: ‘Hey. You might very much want to get straight off, and please say so if you do. But given we’ve both had our Friday nights trashed, fancy a quick drink? Drown our sorrows?’

‘Oh &hellip; ? Sure.’

Laurie surprised herself by not only accepting, but wanting to. She was secretly gratified that after an hour and a half of confinement together, he didn’t want to get away from her as fast as possible. And she didn’t think for a second Jamie was trying it on, either. She understood what he meant, she felt it too: going home now to dinner for one was pure surrender. They couldn’t let the lift win.

‘Nice one,’ Jamie said, with a dazzling smile, and she momentarily saw a flash of the powers that inflamed boss’s nieces.
