title: Who's That Girl?

Without knowing it, she was sunk. She had picked up the baton from Jack. The journey to ruin starts with a single step.

               I think you'll find my copy describes it as having a tingle of
               green plum acidity and a long melony finish, perfect for long

               I've actually looked it up for the lols. 'A fruit forward blend of
               ripe, zesty flavours. Will trans- port you to Italian vineyards.'
               Will transport you to A&E, more like.

If this sort of instant familiarity had come from a single male colleague, Edie would have treated it as clear flirting. Obviously. But Jack was Charlotte’s boyfriend and she was sat right there, though, so this couldn’t be flirting. It was G-chat, but not a G-chat-up.

They became messaging mates. Most mornings, Jack found some witticism to kick things off. He was catnip to someone with Edie’s quick wit, and he seemed entranced by her. He had an easy self-confidence, and ran on dryly humorous remarks and giant Americanos. 

In the boredom of office life, the ping of a new message from Jack on her screen became inextricably associated with pleasure and reward. Edie was like a lab rat in a scientific experiment, pressing a lever that gave her a nut. To follow the analogy, sooner or later it’d give her an electric shock, and she’d prove the mechanics of addiction by keeping on pressing for another nut. 

It was all a bit of fun.

Even when the conversation naturally strayed into slightly more serious, personal topics. Amid the anecdotes, the casual intimacy and larks, she found herself telling him things she hadn’t told anyone in London. 

Edie found her spirits dip at home time on a Friday &mdash; a funny reversal &mdash; realising there’d be no more ‘special chemistry’ chatter until Monday. 
Eventually, there were text-jokes from Jack at the weekend &mdash; saw this, thought of you &mdash; and favouriting of her tweets, and explosively she’d even occasionally get the notification he’d Liked an old photo of hers, buried in the archives on Facebook. Truly, the footprint on the windowsill of social media courting. 

Jack would sometimes say in front of Charlotte, during the Friday night drinks, that he’d shamelessly distracted Edie at work. Charlotte tutted and chided Jack and apologised to Edie &mdash; and then Edie definitely felt a whisper of guilt. 

But, why? For conversation that Jack was openly acknowledging in front of his girlfriend that he instigated? If it was anything untoward, it’d be secret, right? 

There was enough plausible deniability to park a bus.
