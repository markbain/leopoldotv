### Delia thought she knew where her story was headed, but she’s been dealt a nasty plot twist. It’s time to become author of her own fate…
 

Delia Moss isn’t quite sure where she went wrong.

When she proposed and discovered her boyfriend was sleeping with someone else – she thought it was her fault.

When she realised life would never be the same again – she thought it was her fault.

And when he wanted her back like nothing had changed – Delia started to wonder if perhaps she wasn’t to blame…

From Newcastle to London and back again, with dodgy jobs, eccentric bosses, secret superheroes, message board trolls and annoyingly handsome journalists thrown in, Delia must find out where her old self went – and if she can ever get her back.
