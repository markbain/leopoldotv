### What happens when the one that got away comes back?

Rachel and Ben. Ben and Rachel. It was them against the world. Until it all fell apart. It’s been a decade since they last spoke, but when Rachel bumps into Ben one rainy day in Manchester, the years melt away.

They’d been partners in crime and the best of friends at university. But life has moved on: Ben is married. Rachel is not. Yet in that split second, Rachel feels the old friendship return. And along with it, the broken heart she’s never been able to mend. Has she got a second chance with Ben? And if she has got that chance, should she take it?

### Hilarious, heartbreaking and everything in between, you’ll be hooked from their first ‘hello’.
