### Two strangers. One big coincidence. Driving each other crazy is just the beginning &hellip;

Harriet Hatley is running away from everything.

Getting married. Her boyfriend’s family. Her past.

A dream house-share seems like the perfect place to hide, but her unlikely housemate Cal is no stranger to running away himself. And he's also hiding secrets of his own &hellip;

Can these two take a crazy risk, face the past and finally find a reason to stay?
