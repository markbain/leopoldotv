### Delia Moss isn’t quite sure where she went wrong.

When she proposed and discovered her boyfriend was sleeping with someone else &mdash; she thought it was her fault.

When she realised life would never be the same again &mdash; she thought it was her fault.

And when he wanted her back like nothing had changed &mdash; Delia started to wonder if perhaps she was not to blame &hellip;

From Newcastle to London and back again, with dodgy jobs, eccentric bosses and annoyingly handsome journalists thrown in, Delia must find out where her old self went &mdash; and if she can ever get her back.
