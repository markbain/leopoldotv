### She found The One. But when everyone wants him, can she keep him?

When there's a ring on her doorbell on Christmas Day, there's only one person Edie Thompson wants it to be. The person who's still in her heart. The person who just might be The One.

She and Elliot Owen called it quits once before &mdash; but aren't they too good together not to try? And here he is &mdash; offering her everything she dreamed of.

But dating Elliot, an actor, is anything but plain sailing. Being an ocean apart and followed by the press is one thing, but when Edie's friends and Elliot's family are drawn in, things get messy. Then her boss hires a friendly face in the form of Declan Dunne, who's there for her when times are tough, and Edie starts to wonder &hellip; are she and Elliot a fairytale come true &mdash; or a cautionary fable about getting what you wish for?
