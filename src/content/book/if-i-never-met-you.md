### If faking love is this easy &hellip; how do you know when it's real?

Laurie and Jamie have the perfect office romance (They set the rules via email).

Everyone can see they're head over heels (They staged the photos).

This must be true love (They're faking it).

When Laurie is dumped by her partner of eighteen years, she's blindsided. Not only does she feel humiliated, they still have to work together.

So when she gets stuck in the lift with handsome colleague Jamie, they hatch a plan to stage the perfect romance. Revenge will be sweet &hellip;

But this fauxmance is about to get complicated. You can't break your heart in a fake relationship &mdash; can you?
